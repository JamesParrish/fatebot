# Fatebot
Tools for the FATE RPG

## Usage

Build code and start both using `yarn run start` or `npm run start`

## Commands

Commands are:

- `!init [players]` - Start a new session with the specified players
- `!chips` - Show the current chip status
- `!give <player>` - Give a chip to the player
- `!take <player>` - Take a chip from the player
- `!reset` - End the session

All player commands (eg !initialise, !give) use @ tagging

## Limitations

Fatebot currently only supports one session. Multi-session support may come at a later date.
